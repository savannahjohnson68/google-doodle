# My topic Google Doodle

The topic I chose for the Google Doodle is Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeons & Dragons is a TTRPG (table top role playing game) where you and friends go on adventures as different species and with different abilities to defeat evil, raid dungeons, solve mysteries, and kill monsters. The iconic images of the game are a red dragon, weapons, gold/treasures, and dice. The Red dragon appears on the very first game package from the late 70's. The dice, specifically the D20 (20 sided die) is how you see how you did for attacks, ability checks, damage, health, etc.
